-- @Brief: Return users that have full LF licenses who in the AD Laserfiche Group.
-- If a user's AD attributes has been updated, is a new user in the group, or has been deleted from the group, 
-- the MERGE statement will reflect this in the BHFullLicenceUsers table as well.

-- Set full license group from AD as a SQL Object so we can call it later
-- MemberOf has been redacted, please use the appropriate group name here
-- Top-Level OU has been redacted, please refer to ADSI or AD Admin for correct OU.
-- DC segments have been redacted, easiest way to get correct segment is typing "net time" in cmd.
